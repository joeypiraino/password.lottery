# password.lottery.github.io
This is the creation of a random password generator that responds directly to user input and criteria:

-Code has to start with all possible user input variables such as Alphabetical, Numeric, and Special Characters

-There has to be a conversion to make Uppercase possible for the Alpha values

-Choices of variables were declared outside of the statement so that they can concentrate upon the conditions

-The clicking of the "Password Generation" button asks for the userâ€™s personal input of which kinds of variables they want included in their password

- if/else statements were created for all of the possible outcomes, including denial of input

-The password array needs to be converted into a string

-The final product password is displayed in the textbox
